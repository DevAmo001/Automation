This Python project uses the `openpyxl` library to process an Excel workbook (`transactions.xlsx`). Here's a short description of what it does:

1. **Loads an Excel Workbook**:
   - The workbook is loaded using `openpyxl`, and a specific sheet (`Sheet1`) is accessed.

2. **Applies a Discount**:
   - For each row starting from the second row, the script reads the value in the third column (assumed to be a price), applies a 10% discount (multiplies by 0.9), and writes the corrected price to a new column (fourth column).

3. **Creates a Bar Chart**:
   - A bar chart is created using the corrected prices from the fourth column and added to the sheet at position `E2`.

4. **Saves the Workbook**:
   - The modified workbook is saved with the same filename, preserving the changes.

### **Purpose**:
This script automates the process of applying a discount to a list of prices in an Excel file and visualizes the corrected prices using a bar chart. It's useful for tasks like financial data processing and reporting.
